      <p>Hi there! Thank you for stopping by my page!<p>
          <p>My name is Adesemi Elumaro but my friends call me Dese (pronounced day-shay)!
              I was born here in the United States but have grown up in Nigeria (my home country),
              England, and India! I am currently a sophomore at Duke University majoring in Computer
              Science and minoring in Economics and Theater Studies! I am really interested in exploring
              how the intersection of technology, finance, and business can help Nigeria and other developing
              countries play a larger role in the global economy. Let's talk about how we can make the world a 
              better place! I am currently in Charlotte, NC.<p>
                  <p>You can reach me at ace29@duke.edu or semielumaro@gmail.com<p>
